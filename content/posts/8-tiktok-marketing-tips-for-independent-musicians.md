# Tiktok Marketing for Independent Musicians

## Introduction

Tiktok is a popular app that allows you to make videos, share them on social media and get loads of likes. Since TikTok is often featured on the App Store as one of its top apps, it's no surprise that more and more musicians are using it to promote themselves—and their music! If you're an independent musician looking for ways to gain new followers on TikTok, read this article for my top eight tips:

## 8 tiktok tips and trends for Independent Musicians

### 1. Share your music.

If you’re an indie artist, don't be shy about sharing your own original songs on TikTok. The more people that hear it, the better.

### 2. Engage with fans.

Listen to comments and react to them in a genuine way — this is a great way for viewers to see who's behind the account as well as how active they are with their community members (and it makes them feel valued). Think of ways you can engage them further than just liking or commenting back; try doing challenges! Or create polls where fans can vote on what kind of content they want next (this one takes some planning ahead though).

### 3. Be creative!

Don't be afraid of duets, or collaborating with other artists in general if it ends up working out well enough—it's okay if some videos don't turn out as planned either; just learn from your mistakes and keep trying new things until something sticks.

### 4. Share content other than your music.

The content you share on Tiktok should be relevant to your music, but it also needs to be relevant to your fans.

You don't need to post the same thing over and over again on Tiktok; take advantage of the fact that you can post multiple videos in a row!

### 5. Engage with people in your messages.

If a user interacts with your message, you can use that to your advantage.

If someone posts a comment on one of your videos, reply to it!

If someone likes or shares a post of yours, go ahead and like or share theirs.

If someone follows you, follow them back!

Engaging with people in this way is an easy way to grow your followers and build relationships with new fans.

### 6. Think outside the box to create new content beyond songs.

Create a new video a day.

Use challenges to create videos.

Create videos with friends.

Make videos that are fun and entertaining.

Use Tiktok to promote your music and other social media accounts.

### 7. Don't be afraid of duets.

Dua: The duet is a great way to connect with fans and grow your fanbase, but it's also a fun way to find new people who like your music.

Musician 1: If you post that you're doing a duet, then other musicians will be like "Oh cool I want to do one too" and then they'll post their own duets.

Musician 2: I've had some really creative collaborations with other artists on Tiktok because of these types of posts. And it's been really fun!

### 8. Add captions.

Captions are a great way to add context and personality to your videos. They can help you reach new audiences, stand out from the crowd, and build your brand.

You might be wondering: aren't captions just for deaf people? Not always! If you're making music videos or vlogs with dialogue in them, adding captions can also help viewers browse while they're listening to your song or watching you talk about it.

### 9. Stop using trending sounds

You are not your audience.

A lot of artists try to do what they think the audience wants, which is why there are so many songs with generic verses and choruses. The problem is that this also makes them sound like other artists who were trying to do the same thing. There’s a reason why everyone uses that same beat from Drake’s “Hotline Bling,” after all: It was popular because it was trendy! But being trendy isn't always going to work in your favor because you're now tied down by the whims of an unthinking mass market that doesn't know any better than what they see on their Facebook feed or TikTok (nowadays). The best way around this trendiness trap is simply not copying others' sounds—don't use trending sounds, don't use catchphrases or lyrics from other artists' hits, don't use repetitive rhythm patterns if your prior songs have them already...just avoid anything remotely familiar-sounding if possible!

### 10. Make videos using challenges, but be careful not to ride the bandwagon too late.

If you're not sure what a TikTok challenge is, they're videos where people post clips of themselves doing something wacky and/or fun. For example, one super popular one is called "The Cringe." In this case, the participants have to do something embarrassing in public.

Another way to use challenges in your marketing strategy is by making your own challenge that includes the elements of the original challenge but also includes new ideas that you think will be relevant for your audience. This way you can ride on the popularity of a certain trend without falling into the trap of doing something just because it's popular at that moment in time (like some people who pretended they were actually drinking Tide laundry detergent).

## Conclusion

TikTok is another place to share your music and have fun with it, just make sure to engage with fans and be creative along the way.

You're not the only one who can use TikTok to share their music. Many artists are posting their songs on this platform, and many fans are listening to them.

There are a few things you can do to make sure your music is getting heard by as many people as possible. First, make sure that it's easy for people to find your account by making sure all of the necessary information is on there: name, bio, links back to other social media pages (like Twitter), etc. If someone likes what they hear but can't remember how they found out about it or what it was called later down the road when they want more tracks from that artist then chances are they won't be able to find it again without lots of effort!

Another great way for artists who use TikTok is by creating an atmosphere around themselves where other creators feel comfortable enough opening up about themselves in hopes of being noticed by bigger names within the community itself since there aren't any official rules against posting links/content from elsewhere on platforms like Twitter or Facebook either way so long as its relevant content; otherwise known as cross-pollination which helps create deeper connections between users even when sharing different types of media formats such as audio versus video clips too!

You might be thinking that TikTok is just another platform for the next generation of musicians to share their music. But there are so many more ways to use TikTok than just posting videos! It's an amazing place where you can connect with fans, engage with them and create content that shows your personality. And if you're worried about sounding like everyone else on there? Don't be—you have your own unique style that will shine through no matter what platform you're using (and remember: always use hashtags!).
